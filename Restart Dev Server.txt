  If you want to ensure all old processes are killed first:

  1. Close all Electron/DBx Connector Vue windows
  2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to project:
  cd C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\Databuild-API-Vue
  3. Kill any lingering Electron processes:
  taskkill /F /IM electron.exe
  3. (It's okay if this says "not found" - it means no processes are running)
  4. Start fresh server:
  npm run dev
